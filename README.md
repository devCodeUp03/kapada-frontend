# 🛍️ Kapada Frontend

The **Kapada Frontend** is a modern web application built with **React + Vite** and styled using **Tailwind CSS**. 
It serves as the client-side interface of the Kapada project — a platform for browsing, purchasing, and managing clothing items online. The frontend communicates with a backend API using **Axios** and implements features like authentication, shopping cart, notifications, and payment processing.
